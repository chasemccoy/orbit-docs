title: How Orbit Works
---
Orbit is a CSS framework designed for creating radial layouts. It offers simplicity, effectiveness, ease of use, and tremendous versatility for crafting compelling designs.

The Orbit CSS framework simplifies the creation of radial layouts, mimicking traditional row-based structures in a radial format. It offers extensive customization options and supports nesting for building intricate designs tailored to your requirements.

### Step 1: Adding a Bigbang
**Bigbang** class is a wrapper for your Orbit project. Only one Bigbang is needed for each Orbit porject or Orbit instance if you have multiples Orbits in same page. 

### Step 2: Adding a Gravity Spot
A **Gravity Spot** is a container for orbits. Each Gravity Spot has a default size of 500px but can be easily adjusted to fit your project's needs. Inside an Gravity Spot, radial elements will adhere to this size. For example, the maximum diameter of an orbit within this zone will be 500px.

### Step 3: Adding Orbits
Within the Gravity Spot container, you can add **orbits** using size classes ranging from `orbit0` to `orbit12`, creating concentric circles. Child Gravity Spot can also be added. Think of orbits as rows in traditional CSS frameworks.

### Step 4: Adding Radial Elements
Each orbit can contain **radial elements** such as `satellites`, `slices`, `vectors`, `texts`, `progress` indicators, and `sides`. These elements are evenly distributed along the orbit's perimeter, allowing for detailed radial designs tailored to specific needs.

### Step 5: Nesting Gravity Spot
**Gravity Spot** can be nested within `satellites`, enabling the creation of complex radial structures.

### Step 6: Customizing
There are numerous `CSS class utilities` to use with all Orbit elements. For instance, to distribute satellites within a range of 180 degrees, you can use the `.range-180` class on the parent orbit element. The documentation provides a full, detailed explanation of all class utilities.
