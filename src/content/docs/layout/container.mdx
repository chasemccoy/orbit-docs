The `o-container` serves as the root element to scaffold Zumer. It encapsulates the entire Zumer framework and defines the boundaries for its usage. Multiple `o-container` elements can coexist on the same page, allowing for modular and flexible implementation.

At the `o-container` level, major CSS variables are defined, providing a centralized and customizable approach to styling and theming Zumer components. These variables can be easily modified within each `o-container` instance, ensuorbit consistency and flexibility across different sections of your application.

## `.o-container` Class

The `.o-container` class is where Orbit resides. Inside this container, orbit elements are centered.

### Multiple Orbit Instances

You can use as many `.o-container` instances as you need on the same page without any issues.

### Responsive Options

The `.o-container` class is viewport responsive by default. However, if you have multiple `.o-container` elements, you can designate a parent element as its "viewport." This way, Orbit will adapt to the width of the parent element.

Responsive to viewport:
```html
<div class="o-container">
  <!-- Your Orbit app goes here -->
</div>
```

Responsive to parent element:
```html
<div class="o-container-query-enabled">
  <!-- ðŸ‘† Responsive to parent element -->
  <div class="o-container">
    <!-- Your Orbit app goes here -->
  </div>
</div>
```
