### `o-progress` (CSS Only)

The `progress` component works with orbits and is particularly useful for creating circular progress bars or knobs. It is implemented using CSS and gradient properties, allowing for easy customization and styling.

```html
  <div class="orbit-1">
    <div class="progress" style="--progress: 75">
    </div>
  </div>
```
