The `label` component is used to place labels on orbiters within the Zumer radial grid. It can be customized with the same shapes as orbiters and includes a connector line for visual clarity.

```html
  <div class="orbiter">
     <div class="label pos-45">
      <span class="text">Hi there!</span>
    </div>
  </div>
