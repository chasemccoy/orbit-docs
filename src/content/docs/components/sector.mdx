If orbits resemble rows, the `sector` class can be thought of as columns in the Zumer radial grid. An `sector` is a radial segment that serves as the background support for radial designs, but also may work standalone as buttons for instance. It offers customizable options, allowing you to fine-tune its appearance to suit your specific needs.

With the `sector` class, you can customize properties such as width, gap, offset, sector length, border curvature, and more. This level of control enables you to create visually stunning and unique radial layouts.

By experimenting with different configurations, you can achieve a wide range of design aesthetics, whether you prefer a sleek and minimalistic look or a more intricate and expressive pattern.

```html
    <div class="pod">
      <div class="orbit-1 orbiters-3">
        <div class="sector"></div>
        <div class="sector"></div>
        <div class="sector"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
```

In this example, three sectors are placed in a orbit. To draw three sectors that cover the entire orbit, you need to include the `orbiters-3` class in the orbit element. Additionally, you can utilize other parent options to customize the start angle and sector length.

- Use the `offset-*` class to specify the starting angle of the sectors within the orbit.
- Employ the `limit-*` class to define the length of the orbit sector covered by the sectors.


## `o-sector` class

Sector are elements placed around their orbits and function as another way to display content. Think of them as radial slices. Orbit support 24 sectors per orbit that are distributed regularly along the orbit diameter. However, offset, angle limits, and direction could the defined in the orbit element. 

```html
<div class="o-orbit">
  <div class="o-sector">Play</div>
  <div class="o-sector">Pause</div>
  <div class="o-sector">Stop</div>
</div>
```
