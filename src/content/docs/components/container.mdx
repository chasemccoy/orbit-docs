title: o-container
---

The `o-container` serves as the root element to scaffold Zumer. It encapsulates the entire Zumer framework and defines the boundaries for its usage. Multiple `o-container` elements can coexist on the same page, allowing for modular and flexible implementation.

At the `o-container` level, major CSS variables are defined, providing a centralized and customizable approach to styling and theming Zumer components. These variables can be easily modified within each `o-container` instance, ensuorbit consistency and flexibility across different sections of your application.
