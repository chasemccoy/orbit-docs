The `orbit-*` classes act as guides for positioning other elements within the Zumer radial grid. Think of them as rows in the grid structure. They play an important role in organizing and aligning elements within the circular layout of Zumer.

Currently, there are six predefined orbit levels available (`orbit-1`, `orbit-2`, `orbit-3`...). Each orbit level is separated by a distance of 50px, creating a visually pleasing spacing between elements. However, you have the flexibility to adjust the distance as needed by utilizing CSS variables.

By leveraging the `orbit-*` classes, you can easily position and arrange elements within the Zumer radial grid, achieving harmonious and visually appealing circular designs.

It is possible to use multiple same level `orbit-*` to stack differente elements.
