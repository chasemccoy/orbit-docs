Get ready to explore the innovative approach of radial design with Orbit! This guide will help you quickly get started and install everything you need.

### Step 1: Include Orbit stylesheet

To start using Orbit, include its CSS in your HTML file. You have two options:

1. **Download or Import the CSS file**:
   - **Download**: Download the CSS file from [Orbit's repository](#) and link it in your HTML file:
     ```html
     <head>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/orbit.css">
     </head>
     ```
   - **Import**: Add the following to your stylesheet:
     ```css
     @import url('path/to/orbit.css');
     ```

2. **Include via CDN**:
   - Add this to your HTML file:
     ```html
     <head>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@zumerlab/orbit/orbit.css">
     </head>
     ```

### Step 2: Include Orbit JavaScript (Recommended)

If you plan to use additional features like radial progress bars, curved text, and sectors, include Orbit's JavaScript. You can do this in two ways:

1. **Download the JavaScript file**:
   - Download from [Orbit's repository](#).
   - Link it in your HTML file:
     ```html
     <head>
       <script src="path/to/orbit.js" defer></script>
     </head>
     ```

2. **Include via CDN**:
   - Add this to your HTML file:
     ```html
     <head>
       <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@zumerlab/orbit/orbit.js" defer></script>
     </head>
     ```

### Step 3: Set up Orbit layout

Now, create a container with the `orbit-zone` class, and within it, add a radial layout using the `orbit` class. Inside the `orbit`, add elements with the `satellite` class. Hereâ€™s a minimal working example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/orbit.css" />
    <script src="/path/to/orbit.js" defer></script> <!-- Only if using additional features -->
    <title>Orbit Quick Start</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="orbit-zone">
      <div class="orbit">
        <div class="satellite">1</div>
        <div class="satellite">2</div>
        <div class="satellite">3</div>
      </div>
      <div class="orbit">
        <o-label>Curved text</o-label>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 4: Install via Package Manager (Optional)

You can also install Orbit using npm or yarn for easier management in your project:

```sh
npm install @zumerlab/orbit
```
