description: Exploring the Inner Workings of Orbit
---

**Introduction:**

Orbit, a CSS radial library, was conceived with a clear vision - to streamline the development of circular user interface designs. Whether your objective is to construct circular menus, craft data visualization elements, or bring unconventional circular interfaces to life, Orbit has been  designed to equip developers with an intuitive and lightweight toolkit. Here, we will delve into the fundamental principles, overarching vision, and key design considerations that underpin Orbit.

**Principles:**

1. **Simplicity and accessibility:** At the core of Orbit lies the fundamental principle of making radial interface creation accessible to developers of all backgrounds and skill levels. We have prioritized simplicity in design and implementation, ensuring that even those new to web development can harness the capabilities of circular UIs.

2. **Versatility:** Orbit is engineered with a strong focus on versatility, enabling its utilization in a diverse array of applications. It accommodates circular menus, facilitates data visualization, and encourages the exploration of innovative circular design concepts, granting developers the freedom to experiment across various use cases.

3. **Pure CSS, NO JavaScript required:** Orbit has been designed with a lightweight, 100% CSS-based structure. Orbit eliminates the typical reliance on JavaScript for circular UIs, making it a more accessible and flexible solution for developers.

**Vision:**

The vision driving Orbit is to become a solution for individuals seeking to fashion circular UIs. We are committed to endowing developers with the tools required to break free from the confines of conventional rectangular designs, enabling them to explore the boundless creative potential inherent to circular interfaces. We aim to make circular design more accessible, encouraging innovation and creativity by providing user-friendly tools.

**Reasons behind Orbit:**

1. **Addressing the void in Circular Design Tools:** The genesis of Orbit stemmed from the recognition that the CSS design landscape was devoid of adequate resources for crafting circular UIs. Traditional CSS frameworks predominantly emphasized rectangular layouts, leaving circular design concepts relatively unexplored. Orbit is greatly inspired by the pioneering concepts introduced by ZircleUI. ZircleUI, with its emphasis on circular user interfaces and the introduction of unique navigation paradigms, has been a significant wellspring of creative influence for the development of Orbit. ZircleUI's groundbreaking work in the arena of circular design has been a driving force behind the evolution of Orbit.

2. **Enhancing User Engagement:** Circular designs have the innate ability to captivate users in distinctive ways. Whether it is through circular menus, data visualizations, or navigational elements, circular UIs have the potential to elevate user engagement and construct unforgettable experiences.

3. **Empowering Developers:** Orbit is poised to empower developers, granting them the freedom to think beyond conventions. We firmly believe that web development should serve as a canvas for unbridled creativity, and circular designs present an uncharted realm of possibilities.

**Prefix "o-" for compatibility:**

The introduction of the "o-" prefix in Orbit's class nomenclature has been a conscientious choice aimed at ensuring compatibility and preventing conflicts when Orbit is used in conjunction with other CSS frameworks. This prefix guarantees that Orbit can seamlessly coexist with other libraries and frameworks, granting developers the flexibility to select tools that align with their specific needs without the headache of naming conflicts.


In conclusion, Orbit is a CSS radial library that simplifies the process of creating circular UI designs, underpinned by principles of simplicity, versatility, and performance. Its vision is to empower developers to explore creative circular interfaces and seamlessly integrate with other CSS frameworks. The utilization of the "o-" prefix ensures compatibility, making Orbit an invaluable addition to the toolkit of any developer seeking to craft stunning circular user interfaces.
